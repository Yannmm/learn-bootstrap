#Buttons#

https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/buttons/

Today I learnt buttons since it's introduced in the bootstrap documentation. I think the best way to learn is to read docs. While I feel no clues where to start. So I try to watch some youtube videos of bootstrap5 tutorials. In this way, hopefully to get some basic ideas of where to start reading the docs.
